Notes about camera, spirit, and map movement

Camara and spirit are actually moving together its just we need to make sure
the spirit is not moving out of frame so we need to stick it in a fixed position hence we minus the
position of camera (implementation refers to the code)

So when the player moves, the map moves in the opposite direction
Lets say player move right hence position_x increases, then we decrease the position_x of map rendering position
so it creates the motion of map moving

//Frame rate explanation

frameDelay = 1000/60 *1000 is required because sdl process time in miliseconds (1000)
frameStart = SDL_GetTicks(); -> calculate current time
All process takes in place
frameTime = SDL_GetTicks() - frameStart; -> calculate the elapsed time starting from the frameStart
if (frameDelay > frameTime)  -> So if the elapsed time is faster than expected then we delay the scene until the 60FPS is reached
{
    SDL_Delay(frameDelay - frameTime);
}
